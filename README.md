# NetherFix

A mod for Minecrat ReIndev v2.8 that fixes the game freezing when entering/leaving the nether.

To be more specific, when attempting to exit from a portal whose height is greater than the minimum allowed size, your game will freeze. This mod fixes that.

Requires [FoxLoader](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoader) to use.

You can find the jar file in the [releases](https://github.com/Trivaxy/nether-fix/releases) tab.
